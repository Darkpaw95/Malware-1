Malware
=======

Malware related code. Mostly to learn stuff to solve challenges I face
when looking at bad software. 

 * Glastopf - Scripts for working with Glastopf. Mostly DB / reporting stuff
 * Kippo - Mostly reporting scripts for Kippo
 * VirusTotal - Scripts for working with the VT API
 * Web - Stuff for web related malware, usually PHP shells and the like
 * PE - Stuff for Windows related malware

Some of this code will be incomplete. I have the attention span of a gnat.

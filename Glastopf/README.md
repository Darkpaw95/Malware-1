If you're not using [Glastopf](https://github.com/glastopf/glastopf) as your web honeypot, you
might be doing something wrong.

These are just some scripts I pulled together to look at the log file


glastopf-report.sh
------------------

Just a quick and dirty bash script to pull useful info from your Glastopf log file.

Usage: 

 ./glastopf-report.sh /path/to/your/glastopf.log

Useful stuff in the report:

 * Total sessions
 * Offenders
 * Requested URLs

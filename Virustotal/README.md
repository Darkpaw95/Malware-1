Virus Total stuff
=================

Virus total stuff...mostly for their public API


 * vtevilsubmit.py - Submit files and URLs to their service 
 * vthash.py - Old hash checker for the v1 API
 * vthashcheck.py - New hash checker for v2 API using the requests module
 * vtevilsubmit_v2.py - New script for the V2 API. 



vtevilcheck_v2.py
-----------------

This script takes a number of arguments. 

 * -h for basic help
 * -k to specify a different key file to ~/.virustotal.key
 * -H to check VT for a specific hash
 * -r to check VT for a resource. This can be a hash, scan ID value or a URL
 * -f to submit a file to VT for scanning
 * -u to submit a URL to VT for scanning
 * -i to get a report on an IP address
 * -d to get a report on a domain name 


It's worth noting that both the file and URL submission checks will perform a 
precheck on VT to see if the file or URL has been submitted already. 



Bugs can go to code at zonbi dot org.






Thanks to the VT crew for being full of awesome
